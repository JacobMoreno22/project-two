        <p1 style="color: violet;"><img src="img/drafting.jpg" alt="drafting" style="width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 15px;">Computer Aided Drafting(CAD) is a field I'm truly passionate about, I don't know how to explain the feeling when I'm sitting in front of a computer just designing a floor plan of a house or a front, side, and rear view of a house, It's almost like I feel at home because I feel really comfortable. I'm grateful to have learned from two great teachers with my first teacher that showed me was my freshman year in high school, he made it easy for me by just the way he explained to all the students and when he'd see my finished assignments he would encourage me to get into this field of work when I graduate and so I listened and I enrolled into a trade school essentially for CAD where I met another great teacher from which my parents first met and explained to him how I've done this in high school and shown them my assignments so it was like I had pressure to really prove I was everything they said and I can say I definitely lived up to his expectations because he always had positive things to say about my finished projects. Not only that but he just exlpained new things that I never learned in high school so easy, assignments that looked very odd and intimidating, he showed me that they were not that at all. Currently I'm still trying to get into this field but it's taking some time.</p1>

        <p2 style="color: red;"><img src="img/basketball.jpg" alt="myinterests" style="width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-right: 15px;">A little about my interests are that I'm a huge fan of basketball, whether it's the NCAA or the NBA, I'm watching both. I've been watching and playing basketball since I was 6 with the first player I witnessed was Kobe Bryant and I instantly fell in love with the sport by just watching how he shoot the ball, how he played defense and just put his heart and soul, blood, sweat, and tears into this beautiful sport. That's when I instantly became a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers with my favorite player of all time being Kobe Bryant, he's my GOAT! <br>Another interest of mine is video games, when I'm not busy, like working or doing errands, I'm playing video games in off time. My first controller I picked up was an original Playstation dualshock controller and I remember playing a military game, it was all green soldiers, just like the ones from Toy Story. Then when I was 6 I got my first Playstation 2 with my very first game I owned was Need for Speed Underground and just the joy I had on my face was like a kid in a candy shop, and ever since then I've been on team Playstation. My favorite genres being Racing, Sports, Action, Action-Adventure, RPG!</p2>

        <p3 style="color: indigo;"><img src="img/coding.jpg" alt="webdevelopment" style="width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 15px;">I am currently in web development training at Bitwise Industries where I am getting hands on training in languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many more soon to come. It's a bit challenging, something I have no experience in but it's an experience and it's always good to step out of your comfort zone and try new things, learn new things that you may have never even had any idea what they were because who knows, you may excel in that new field. <br> I'm excited to continue to learn new languages and new methods to make my websites more professional and beautiful! Currently I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, and very little knowledge in JavaScript, but we had just barely started learning JavaScript and so far it's a bit confusing but I'm hanging in there, I'm keeping up with every new material. I'm hoping that after this class ends I will have all the basic knowledge that a beginning Web Developer should have and hopefully with that knowledge I can get accepted for the apprenticeship and really do good in that so I can find a job in this particular field because I find a real enjoying playing around in VSCode and seeing what I could and seeing how my website will look after it's done.</p3>
